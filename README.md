# Holes detection

## Description
The point of this project is to create a program that detects holes in bricks. There is five types of colors and different types of sizes of bricks. The main task is to identify figures made from bricks of different colors and then detect how many holes are in each figure. Results are saved in .json format file.

Color detection is implemented using HSV model, holes are detected using Hough Circle Transformation

This project was a part of end test of the computer vision course.
